Does money derive its value from
the inequality of distribution.
And does the nature of this inequality
look to have a pareto/power law dist.?

Inspiration: If everyone was a billionaire,
no one would be rich.

i.e. the purchasing power of money comes from
inequity of distribution.

If this arises naturally out of the governing laws,
are we doomed to have inequality?

I have no idea how to begin modelling this.
